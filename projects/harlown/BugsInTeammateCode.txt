appts.java

1)	This.startHour = 2;
	makes every starthour start at 2 always. cannot set starthours with parameters of method.
	Test by making any appt with start hour != 2	

2)	if(startHour<-1 || startHour>23)
	allows for -1 hours
	Test by setting a valid appt. Then using setStartHour() to set starthour to -1 hour. 
	IsValid() will still be true
